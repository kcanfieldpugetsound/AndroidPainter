***********************************************************************/

<It draws points, lines, polylines, circles, and rectangles and has painting tools Airbrush and a run-based flood-fill. Lines and circles are based on Bresenham's Algorithm. These are drawn on a bitmap and controlled by drawing-mode and color-selection menus.>

<No. It is not configured in a special way.>

<No extensions were added.>

<approximately 30 hours>


/**********************************************************************

 **********************************************************************/

<Understanding almost every method proved to be somewhat difficult, but the implementation of the algorithms was harder than understanding the algorithms/processes themselves. It took lots of asking questions and thinking about the algorithms to figure out lines and circles and also learning some new programming tricks along the way. For some of the drawing modes, such as circle, I found that I was over-thinking how they should work. I think debugging this project was more difficult than usual because I've never done any drawing at this fundamental scale, so it was harder to think in that context.>

<This assignment makes me really appreciate all of the built in graphics methods for drawing lines, circles, and rectangles. Also, I learned some new programming tricks along the way such as how for-loop conditions do not have to match the counter variable that they initialize and increment/decrement. This will help me think out-of-the-box about code structure in the future.  Overall, this is a great assignment for understanding rasterization and the final result is worth the effort. GRADING NOTE: This assignment was due at 11:59 pm September 22 and submitted at about 4pm September 24. As discussed with you earlier, rather than use both grace days, I would like to use one of my allotted grace days and take a letter-grade-deduction as per your late-work policy so I may save a grace day for the remainder of the semester. Thank you.>
